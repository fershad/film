      "story": "Probably my favourite part of driving around Norway during the summer was stopping off at little roadside stalls like this one that dotted the countryside. In each was a different selection of local fruits and vegetables for sale, most of the time paid for by putting some cash into an honesty box. The berries were absolutely fantastic, better than anything I've had elsewhere.",
